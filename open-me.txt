Oops! Where did your code go?
Here's a riddle while you wonder so:

I come and go like summer rain,
Your precious code, now down the drain.
No git history to save your day,
Those commits? They've gone away!

Your backup plan was rather thin,
Like hoping clouds would make you win.
Now all that's left is this sweet note,
And memories of code you wrote.

What's black and white and "null" all over?
Your source folder, my dear developer! 

P.S. Next time, try version control permissions ðŸ˜‡
... Oh wait, that won't help either! ðŸ˜ˆ
